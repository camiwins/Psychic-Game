# Psychic-Game
For our Javascript assignment, we had to create a simple guessing game and were given two options. I selected the "basic" choice which was a simple letter guessing game.

**Notes from Cami:**
_The main reason for attempting the basic one was to get a clearer understanding of what areas of JS I was comfortable in and which things I needed to go back on. You'll find portions of my code incomplete or unfinished and I have listed them below with the line number of the pseudocode as a reference._

**Incomplete Requirements**
* A function that only ran the game if a letter was pressed (   ```game.js on line 22```)
* When guesses left counter hits 10 characters long, it resets the game with a new computer guess and current user guess (``` game.js on line 57```)

# Game Instructions
Guess what letter the computer is thinking.
1. A correct guess will give you one win point.
2. 10 wrong guesses and you will gain a loss point.
3. After gaining a win or loss point, the computer will pick a new letter and your guesses will reset.
4. Keep playing until you're satisfied with your W/L ratio.

# How Does It Work?
When you open the ```index.html``` file inside a browser, you should see:
* Title of the game and instructions to press any key to play
* Directions on how to play. (Use the keyboard to guess what letter the computer is playing.)
* Text counters displaying the the score: wins, losses and total guesses remaining
* A list of your current guesses will be displayed
